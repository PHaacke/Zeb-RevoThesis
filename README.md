# Zeb-RevoThesis
Matlab script, Computree files, Excel data used and created for MSc thesis: Assessing the accuracy for complex forest stands metrics through synergy of terrestrial and aerial laser scanning data.

The CompuTree files/scripts are all based on Zeb-Revo las files recorded for the MSc thesis. The Zeb-Revo guide uses seperate las files recorded for preliminary research. Both LiDAR data (las/laz etc.) is not attached due to exceeding the size limitation. If you are interested in using the original data please contact me.

The guide also references video guides. These were also to large for uploading and can be received upon contacting me.

CompuTree files are adjusted for each dataset (1-5) They may however crash on execution. It is not clear why this happens and the developer does not give further information. It might therefore be necessary to recreate the steps and replicate the values in the steps to be able to process the Zeb-Revo data.
